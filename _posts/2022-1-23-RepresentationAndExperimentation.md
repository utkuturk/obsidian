- assumption about "shared representation" and repetition

### findings
@Bock1986: passives primes passives

@BockLoebel1990:
	- Finding 1: locatives primes passives
	- Finding 2: metric styles does not matter

@Bock1989: locative PPs and Dative PPs share structure

Priming doesnt require thematic relations to overlap

Passives share structure with locatives. In order for passives to be similar to locatives so that they prime locatives, there should not be a gap/trace.

**Then what is the similarity, which proc similarity?**
- VP, yet but not enough
- VP + <u>identical</u> first level of internal structure (including the order)
	- this kind of explains all the findings above
	- (could be after 'simplification')
- VP + identical first level of <u>overtly realized </u>structure.
	- and their own Mandarin Argument
- 




- "representation"
- acceptability judgments

### source ambiguity
**common claim**: locative PPs are more distant structurally from the verb. Whether or not you can do ellipsis is related to having a constituent or not. Constituents can be targeted. The issue with hierarchy and c-command.

1. Bob read the book on Saturday and Sue did  \[<sub>VP</sub> ~~read the book~~\]  on Sunday
2. \? Book took his mom to NY and Sue did \[<sub>VP</sub> ~~take her mom~~\] to Philly.
3. \? Bob gave a puppy to his mom and Sue did  \[<sub>VP</sub> ~~give a puppy~~\] to her granny.
4. \* Bob put the book on the shelf and Sue did  \[<sub>VP</sub> ~~put the book~~\] on the table

Obviously, @Bock1989's findings are in clash. How 2 and 3 are in priming relation? 
- 2 has a ternary VP: \[<sub>VP</sub> V NP PP\]
3 has a nested structure: \[<sub>VP</sub> \[<sub>VP</sub> V NP\] PP\]

How this priming works then? Maybe like a reduction of repeated embedded VPs


### representation & reality
_are representations real?_

1. Mentalism. Anti-platonist stance.
2. Relevance to real-time processes like speaking and understanding
3. More privileged / direct access to representations





- argument for "monostratal" claim
