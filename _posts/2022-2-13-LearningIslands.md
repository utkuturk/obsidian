- this is one of the many ways that you can think about how people learn islands.
- island stuff is one of the things that people did not even know that they would not be able to do.
	- then we had a lot of questions:
	- are these constraints epiphenomenal
- an interesting paper is Kush et al. from Glossa Psycholinguistics
- Using Computational Models to Test Syntactic Learnability by Wilcox et al. 

## PS Model
- Do kids only learn from child-directed speech?
	- Colin: we do not have enough information about this difference.
	- Structure wise they are quite similar. lexical wise they are different
	- however, there are some instances when there is no example in child-directed speech while there are some in adult-directed speech. 
		- And having one single example will matter a lot, in PS Model
	- having only child-directed model can be thought as a conservative model.
	- Evaluating Meaningful Differences in Leanring and Communication Across SES Backgrounds, by Yi Ting Huang et al.
- Instead of having all sentences, we have container of these sentences.
	- Container is created by following the spine of the structure. 
- What if we just give 0 probability to never-occuring stuff?
	- But we have to have an analyzer that could analyze stuff that he never heard of?
	- This model then assumes only positive data.
	- We need to give our learner some space for learning stuff, so the initial parser is very very generous. 
- Are the kids even this good at parsing? If children were able to do this parsing, then they could do this.


### Learning Problem
- the output of learning is complex
	- examples: that-t, wanna contraction, parastiic gaps, reconstruction etc.
- the output of learning is hard to observe
- cruicial input for learning is hard to observe
	- it is noisy
	- dissimilar from what must be learned
	- rare
- yet learning is robust

#### not-so-obvious variation
- pronouns:
	- while john was reading the book, he ate an apple.
	- while he was reading the book, john ate an apple.
		- both can be john or somebody else
		- english ok, russian not ok
	- john ate an apple while he was reading the book.
	- he ate an apple while john was reading the book.
		- first one can be both, the second one cannot be john.
		- second one coreference is impossible in all languages
- that trace effect
	- ...
