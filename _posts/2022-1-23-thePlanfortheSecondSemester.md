# The plan for the second semester

### connections to be made this semester
- contributing to the linguistic theory by psycholinguistics work
	- sometimes ppl look at psycholinguists as a lifeline. we couldnt solve this, maybe this fancy thing will solve it.
- how much speaking and understanding rely on the same machine. 
- the learning problem and its relation to the rest of all these

### one system
these fields came together on their own timeline, independently. thus they all have independent theories that does not have much to say about the other thing.
- What if we entertain they have one single system?

Last semester was mostly about representations, and how stuff is stored. This semester we will mostly talk about stuff that are not stored but built up on the go. 

### assignments
- read > write > revise.
- revising might be directly correcting what we wrote, tri-weekly data synthesis, or structured notes.

### notes on the schedule
- sol will come on march 15
- march 9-11 hsp in pittsburg
- march 19-25 spring break
